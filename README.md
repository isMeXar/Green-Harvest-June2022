## Project Summary
"Green Harvest" aims to streamline the daily harvest management process for Green Solutions by transitioning from traditional, manual methods to an efficient web-based application. The project encompassed three main phases: requirement gathering, design and conception, and implementation.

### General Description
The application, "Green Harvest," facilitates the seamless management of daily harvest data, optimizing operations for Green Solutions. By leveraging web technologies and adopting a user-centric approach, the application simplifies data entry, tracking, and analysis.

#### Problematic and Proposed Solution
The conventional method of managing harvest data via manual record-keeping proved inefficient and prone to errors for Green Solutions. "Green Harvest" addresses this challenge by providing an online platform for real-time data recording and analysis, thereby enhancing productivity and accuracy.

### Objectives
The primary objectives of "Green Harvest" include:
- Designing and developing a user-friendly web application for efficient harvest management.
- Enabling role-based access control to ensure secure and tailored user experiences.
- Facilitating data visualization and analysis to track statistics, revenues, and crop waste.
- Ensuring quick adoption and usability for all staff members involved in the harvesting process.

### User Characteristics
The target users of "Green Harvest" include company administrators and staff members directly involved in the harvest management process. Users are expected to have a basic understanding of computer systems to utilize the application effectively.

### Scope
The scope of "Green Harvest" encompasses:
- User registration and role assignment by the super-administrator.
- Management of farms, greenhouses, products, and client information.
- Recording daily harvest data and tracking income from exported production.
- Presentation of statistics through tables and charts.

### Requirements Specification
The functional and non-functional requirements of "Green Harvest" are outlined to ensure the application's effectiveness, usability, and security. Functional requirements include user registration, data management, and reporting functionalities, while non-functional requirements focus on performance, usability, security, portability, and maintainability.

## Conclusion
"Green Harvest" represents a significant milestone in streamlining harvest management processes for Green Solutions. This repository documents the journey from project inception to application delivery, highlighting key phases, challenges, and outcomes achieved during the internship period.
